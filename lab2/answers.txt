...student1.cpp:249: This was a segmentation fault because we were accessing invaders[invaderRow][invaderRow] for a non-square matrix. 
To fix this, we simply changed it to invaders[invaderRow][invaderCol] to make sure we hit all the right indices. 

...student1.cpp:27: This was a logic error, as there was an extra semicolon after an if statement, and the following braces acted as an extra scope, thus it would always be run. 
To fix this, we got rid of the semicolon, and the program had the expected output. 

...student1.cpp:62: This was another logic error, where a for loop became infinite, because it had no incrementor. 
This was solved by adding a simple ...; ++colIdx) {...} in the for loop. 

...student2.cpp:218: The problem here is that we were trying to deallocate all of the invaders, and we passed in the matrix size nxm. 
In reality, invaders is mxn, so we modify the code accordingly: DeallocateWarriors(invaders, m, n);

...student2.cpp:113 & 117: These two lines had faulty checks. 
Essentially, the logic was backwards; if the invader had larger power, the protector would win, and vice versa. 
So, to fix this, we simply reversed the operators on the if statements, and our code ran!
